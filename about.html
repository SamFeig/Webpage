                    <p> College is the first time everyone is living alone since they were born, doing many of the tasks that parents have completed for the last 18 years of your life. It is a place of self-discovery and growth unlike what is required up until now in high school.<hr>

                    College today has become an expectation like high school is, and as such, a large portion of the population goes to some form of secondary school. Despite this, not much has changed with overall intelligence or social ideas. People go to college because it is expected of them, not because they want something out of it. I believe in the great importance of education, but proper education, not just for the sake of being in school because others expect it or to get a job. One must absorb information outside of their intended field of study, using this information to come up with new and unique ideas.<hr>

                    I strongly believe in the idea of well-rounded education. High school nowadays has a single purpose of preparing students for college. Many arts and other programs are pushed to the back burner in place of college readiness and mountains of AP classes. College is the place to explore the world, to explore the interconnection between everything and how differing perspectives can be invaluable in future innovation. I want my college experience to be cross disciplinary. So that when I am working, I can draw on a broad range of information. Not just related to my field of study but of disparate disciplines. Drawing on history so as not to repeat past mistakes, and on social sciences and philosophy to understand ethical concerns about my work and then decide when and if an idea should be pursued. College should be a place to build on your knowledge and collect it. Expanding what you thought your interests were to encompass entirely new fields. That is why I plan to take classes outside of engineering, enabling me to build a more rounded pool of knowledge to bring to my future work and to my views of the world.<hr>

                    Education shouldn’t be limited to purely scholastic interests. College is a place of growth and discovery, of the career you want to pursue and of yourself. Discovery of each person’s values and beliefs and of why we believe these things. It should also be a place to spread your wings for the first time and learn what it takes to live in our world. Encountering new ideas and judging for yourself whether to accept or reject it. College is about pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It is about teaching you how to think and approach problems in the world. With the acceptance of college as a given next step after high school, this has been lost. Many people go through the motions to get the slip of paper that proclaims them a college graduate and then can get a job when they should be pausing to think about the why.<hr>

                    There is no single path through college that lands you a dream job. You must make your own path, exploring your many interests and building a web of knowledge that you will draw on. As well as the foundation to continually build on. The world is constantly changing, and it is a necessity that your learning doesn’t suddenly stop once you leave college. College is just the beginning of the continuous process that should last your entire life.</p>
